            Footprint is a powerful yet easy-to-use analytics tool to uncover
            and visualize blockchain data. Our community is critical to help us
            in our mission to make on-chain data accessible for everyone, and we
            created Moon Men to give something special to our contributors and
            encourage more people to get involved in Web3.
            <br />
            <br />
            As of launch, contributors who receive a Moon Men can use it as a
            PFP of astronomical awesomeness and receive a discount on a
            Footprint Business Plan. There are tons of other benefits.
